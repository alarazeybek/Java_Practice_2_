Part 1
you will implement a Java program with a Graphical User
Interface that creates a stick figure object, of varying color and height. For this
purpose, you should have a StickFigure class whose constructor takes the baseX
and baseY coordinates (the coordinates of the bottom-center of the figure), color,
and size (height) of the figure. Then, implement the methods setX and setY to set
the x and y coordinates of the figure. Using these methods, animate the figure by
sliding the figure on the floor from left to right. Use appropriate delay loops to control
the animation so that the animations are visible.
Part 2
In this Part, you will implement the UI elements (buttons, dropdowns, checkboxes,
etc.).
