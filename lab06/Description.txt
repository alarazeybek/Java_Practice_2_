This assignment is about sorting algorithms and recursion.
Part 1
Question 1
Create an interface called ArrayGenerator:
	RandomArrayGenerator: generate a random array of size n.
	DecreasingArrayGenerator: (eg. [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] for n = 8)
	IncreasingArrayGenerator: (eg. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] for n = 8)

Question 2
In this question, youâ€™ll take a deep look at the runtime characteristics of the
MergeSort algorithm.
create a concrete (not abstract) MergeSortAnalyzer class that extends
SortAnalyzer class. Specifically, override the abstract sort method by implementing
the MergeSort algorithm recursively

Question 3
you will develop a MergeSort
algorithm that sorts the given array by dividing it into k sub-problems at each
recursive step and merges them. Now, create a GeneralizedMergeSortAnalyzer
class that extends SortAnalyzer class and implement the sort method recursively.


Part 2
In this part, you will do the same for QuickSort.
