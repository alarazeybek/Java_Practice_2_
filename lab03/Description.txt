In this lab, you will implement a simple text-based game where you are an air
force commander and you are defending your border from enemy vehicles trying
to pass through.
Helicopter - A class that extends EnemyVehicle. The difference between
Helicopter and EnemyVehicle is that Helicopter objects should increase their
speed after each move.
Tank - A class that extends EnemyVehicle. The difference between the Tank
and EnemyVehicle is that Tank objects should take less damage from attacks.
