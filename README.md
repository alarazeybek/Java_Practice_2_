6 solved problems(java).
* Problem 1: Finding the greatest common diviser of two integers by Euclid's Algorithm. Summation & substraction of two equations. Output should be the simplest equation.
* Problem 2: Reading a number from a .txt file. Since this number is greater than long, double, int etc., it should be stored in an array. You should write summation and substraction methods.
* Problem 3: Simple text-based game.
* Problem 4: Learning and implementing GUI with a stickfigure problem.
