Part 1
Write a class IntegerArray that keeps a very large integer in an integer array called digits whereas
each digit will be kept in one element of the array. The constructor takes the number as a String
and adds each digit character by character into the integer array. You can define a class variable to
keep track of the numberâ€™s sign (i.e., positive or negative). Make sure you avoid leading zeros
(00123 = 123) and the orientation of the IntegerArray is correct. You are not allowed to use
BigInteger class (and its variants) in this assignment.
Part 2
Write IntegerArrayList class that keeps a list of IntegerArrays. The only attribute of
IntegerArrayList is an ArrayList of IntegerArrays called numbers. The constructor takes an
ArrayList of Strings that represents IntegerArray and one by one adds them to the numbers list as
IntegerArrays

Sample Run: 
Please enter the filename: *Test3.txt*
Output:
start = 0
middle = 2
end = 4
Minimum of all the numbers:
21
Minimum of the first half:
21
Minimum of the second half:
41
